# Drop1nTheBucket

We will build an interface for a development company to track known bugs for their software. The interface will include bug reports, message boards, developer projects, and various authorities for adding and editing bugs. If other developers need to find or comment on a bug they will have the option to do so as well as rank / upvote the severity of a bug  for higher priority.
